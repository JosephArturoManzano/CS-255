Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project required management of a team creating a system for the company. We utilize the aid of UML diagrams and scheduling charts to organize our team. The customer, DeriverPass, one of those to build them a cloud-based program that can be accessed through a web browser.

What did you do particularly well?

I did my diagrams thoroughly and depicted each requirement, and an easy to read format. Due to our customer, not being experienced in tech jargon, regular speech, and common words were necessary to explain our processes and goals.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to improve upon my diagrams, I feel as if their art form is messy, and not as easy on the eyes as a design team could produce.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The users needs were implemented by depicting each requirement in a separate diagram. Interpreting the users needs is a natural response to me now. I am experience enough in programming for me to understand how I'm going to create a system that will function and code. The users needs are the most important part of the system. The customers paying us to create their vision, therefore we must abide by their choices.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Designing software is the most important part of the process. I like to dumb down the whole system in as little of words or thoughts as possible. I like to elaborate upon each one individually, so I can have them expand in their necessary place. Techniques or strategies I would like to use in the future would be new skills. I will learn. There are more advanced techniques out in the world, and I would like to learn them to further my skill.
