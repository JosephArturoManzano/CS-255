DriverPass Diagrams
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was  intended as practice for myself to create diagrams for a system that a client is requesting. We went over an interview transcript that described requirements requested from the client. The client wanted the system to be an online cloud based web application that gives student drivers the ability to gain access to practice tests and online classes. There is also an option to purchase a package that will you a number of in person driver training sessions.

What did you do particularly well?

I created a system that is simple and easy to expand upon. The sytem is basic and easy for the DriverPass employees to understand.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to improve all the documents I created. There is more details that can be added and more descriptive. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The user's needs are the most important part of the system. Limitations that technology has should be stated upfront and let clients know some needs are impossible. If the user is not satisfied then the user will not want to do business with our company. I practice object oriented programming. The future analyzation skills I will use will be improved upon over time. I will continue to learn and improve in order to have stronger ability to perform well in a workplace.[FinalP2Manzano.pdf](https://github.com/JosephArturoManzano/CS-255/files/8550986/FinalP2Manzano.pdf)
